This notebook is an extension of the excellent analysis at https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/222505_5cc603652e6344879dc5028ddf660688.html. This reimplements the original R code into Python. It also extends the data from the original 2016 set to the latest available in 2019. It also adds the SR22 G6, and the SR20 (G3 and G6).
